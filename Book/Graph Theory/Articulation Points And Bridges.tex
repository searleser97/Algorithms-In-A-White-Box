We say that a vertex $V$ in a graph $G$ with $C$
connected components is an \textit{articulation point} if its removal increases the number of connected components of $G$.
In other words, let $C'$ be the number of connected components after removing vertex $V$, if $C' > C$ then $V$ is an \textit{articulation point}.

for every vertex V in the graph G do
    Remove V from G
    if the number of connected components increases then
        V is an articulation point
    Add V back to G

The complexity of counting the number of \textit{connected components} is $O(V + E)$ therefore,
the total complexity of this naive approach is $O(V * (V + E))$.

First, we need to know that an \textit{ancestor} of some node $V$ is a node $A$ that was discoverd
before $V$ in a DFS traversal. i.e. In the graph of figure \ref{fig:apb_g1} shown above, if we start
our DFS from $A$ and follow the path to $C$ through $B$ ($A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$), then $A$
is an ancestor of $B$ and $C$ in this spanning tree generated from the DFS traversal.\\

\noindent
Now that we know the definition of \textit{ancestor} let's dive into the main idea.

\subsection*{Idea}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Idea}

Let's say there is a node $V$ in some graph $G$ that can be reached by a node $U$ through some
intermediate nodes (maybe non intermediate nodes) following some DFS traversal, if $V$ can also be
reached by $A$ = ''ancestor of $U$'' without passing through $U$ then, $U$ is NOT an articulation point
because it means that if we remove $U$ from $G$ we can still reach $V$ from $A$, hence, the number of
\textit{connected components} will remain the same. Hence, we can conclude that the only 2 conditions for
$U$ to be an \textit{articulation point} are:\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If all paths from $A$ to $V$ require $U$ to be in the graph.
  \item If $U$ is the root of the DFS traversal with at least 2 children subgraphs disconnected from each other.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Then we can break condition \#1 into 2 subconditions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\bullet] $U$ is an \textit{articulation point} if it does not have an adyacent node $V$ that can reach $A$ without
        requiring $U$ to be in $G$.

        \end{figure}
        \newpage
  \item[\bullet] $U$ is an \textit{articulation point} if it is the root of an \textit{outer} cycle in the DFS traversal.

\subsection*{Implementation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Implementation}

The first thing we need, is a way to know if some node $A$ is an ancestor of some other node $V$, for this
we can assign a \textit{discovery time} to each vertext $V$ in the graph $G$ based on the DFS traversal,
so that we can know which node was discovered before or after another, e.g. in the graph of figure \ref{fig:apb_g1} with the traversal
$A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$, the discovery times for each node will be 1, 2, 3 respectively; with this we know that
$A$ was discovered before $C$ since the \textit{discovery time} of $A$ is smaller than the \textit{discovery time} of $C$.\\

\noindent
Now we need to know if some vertex $U$ is an \textit{articulation point}. For that we will check the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If after visiting $U$ following the DFS traversal there is NO way to get to a node $V$ with strictly smaller discovery time
        than the discovery time of $U$, then $U$ is an \textit{articulation point}.
  \item If $U$ is the root of the DFS tree and it has at least 2 children subgraphs disconnected from each other, then $U$ is an
        \textit{articulation point}.
\end{enumerate}
